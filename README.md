# Market Atlas

## Local development

Use Node.js 22.9 or newer. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, add your CoinGecko Demo key, then run:

    npm start

No third-party packages are required. Open the exact URL printed in the terminal. A free port is selected automatically; set `LOCAL_PORT=5173` in `.env` if you want a fixed local port. Use `npm run dev` for backend watch mode.

## Vercel deployment

Extract this ZIP into a clean folder. Do not merge it with an older release that contains `api/index.js`. The old catch-all function has been removed.

Import the project into Vercel with the root directory containing `vercel.json`, `api/`, and `public/`. Choose Framework Preset **Other**. The checked-in configuration sets no build command and sets Output Directory to **public**; remove conflicting dashboard overrides. Add `COINGECKO_DEMO_API_KEY` in Vercel's environment variables for the deployment environment, then deploy/redeploy.

Do not set the build command to `npm start`. The local server is development-only and is not deployed. Vercel functions do not call `listen()` or need a port.

| URL | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| `/` and static assets | `public/`, served directly by Vercel |
| `/api/markets` | `api/markets.js`, independent Node function |
| `/api/token` | `api/token.js`, independent Node function |
| `/token` | Rewrite to `/api/token` |
| `/output` | Rewrite to independent `api/output.js` |
| `/api/output` | Authenticated access to `data/output.json` |

## Authenticated output and one-second expiry

1. Put your valid JSON data in `data/output.json`, outside `public/`.
   Remove any old `public/output.json` before deploying: static files bypass function authentication.
   No output data was supplied, so this release includes no output.json.
2. Generate a random secret with:

       node -e "console.log(require('node:crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"

   Set it as `OUTPUT_ACCESS_PASSWORD` in your local .env and Vercel environment.
   Keep the secret in trusted clients and on the server, never in public frontend code.
3. Send GET `/token?purpose=output` with header `Authorization: Bearer <password>`.
   The response contains `val`, `issuedAt`, `expiresAt`, and `expiresInMs: 1000`.
   This explicit access-token mode responds without waiting for CoinGecko.
   Ordinary `/token` still returns BTC/ETH prices.
4. Immediately send GET `/output` with header `Authorization: Bearer <val>`.
   Use `/output?format=text` for the original JSON file as text/plain, or
   `/output?format=json` (the default) for application/json.
   Tokens and passwords are not accepted in URL query parameters.

The token encrypts and authenticates a millisecond timestamp, random nonce, and
client IP using AES-256-GCM. The timestamp is captured when the access-token
handler starts. Requests more than 1,000 ms later are rejected with HTTP 401;
exactly 1,000 ms is accepted. An IP mismatch returns HTTP 403. Missing/invalid
credentials return 401, and a missing server secret returns 503.

Every client follows the same rules regardless of browser or User-Agent.
Only formatting changes between JSON and text; the data is the same.
The endpoint reads and validates JSON only; it never executes file contents.

The encrypted token carries the timestamp, so expiry works across separate
Vercel instances without an in-memory timestamp map. Each issued token has its
own lifetime; issuing another token does not revoke earlier tokens. This is
expiry validation, not single-use enforcement: a token can be reused from the
same IP within its one-second lifetime. Multiple clients behind the same public
IP cannot be distinguished by IP alone.

On Vercel, the implementation uses the platform's
[`x-vercel-forwarded-for` header](https://vercel.com/docs/headers/request-headers#x-vercel-forwarded-for).
Locally it uses the socket IP and ignores forwarded headers.
Network latency and cold starts may exceed this strict one-second window;
the client must then request a new access token. No automatic grace period is added.

Authenticated requests return 404 if the data file is absent, or 500 if it is
invalid JSON. GET and HEAD are supported on output; other methods return 405.
Redeploy after changing the data file or secret.

Shared provider utilities live in `lib/`, outside the public folder and API entrypoints. Only the local router in `scripts/` combines routes for local development.

## Real data and failure handling

The markets function requests 50 assets with names, logos, prices and seven-day chart history. The token function independently requests Bitcoin and Ethereum USD prices using CoinGecko's lightweight price endpoint. Successful token GET requests log both prices to the Node console (Vercel function logs when deployed).

Each upstream attempt has an 8-second timeout, with at most one retry for transient failures. Authorization failures and rate limits are not immediately retried. Both functions have a configured 30-second maximum duration; the browser waits up to 25 seconds.

Market responses are cached for 45 seconds, token responses for 15 seconds. Requests share an in-flight fetch within the same instance. After failure, verified cached prices can be returned for at most 15 minutes, labeled `mode: stale`. A cold instance with no cached data returns HTTP 503 with an explicit error and Retry-After header, never fabricated prices. These caches are per warm function instance, not persistent or shared across instances. CoinGecko outages and plan limits can still make data unavailable.

The browser preserves recent verified data on refresh failures and marks it delayed. Charts support price hints by hovering, tapping, or using keyboard arrow keys.

Keep the API key server-side in the environment, never in frontend code. Rotate any key previously shared publicly.

## Verification

    npm test

Tests use mocked provider responses and local HTTP requests. They cover separate function exports, Vercel configuration, route aliases, market/token responses, retry/failure handling, stale-data behavior and chart helpers. They do not prove a live CoinGecko connection or a successful Vercel deployment.
